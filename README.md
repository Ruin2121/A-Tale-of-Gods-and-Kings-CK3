# A Tale of Gods and Kings

A Tale of Gods and Kings (AToGaK) is a *VERY* work-in-progress mod for Crusader Kings III.

The objective of this mod is to slowly and steadily make changes to the game world that reflect real history as closely as possible, while blending in fantasy elements that played a significant role in history. It is unlikely that this mod will be compatible with others out of the box and I will not focus on compatibility either.

Since the focus is on historical accuracy blended with fantasy, citations should be added into the files pointing to sources at all times. Even fantasy elements must be attested by a source to be included in the game.

When disputed historical sources are found relating to a change, the source that is believed to be the most reliable should be used. The related change should reflect that unless there is a very good reason not to reflect it accurately (and if this is the case, it should be noted with reasoning).

I have published this on github for safe keeping and to allow collaboration.
